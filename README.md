Data Mining on Yelp and Census Data 
-------------------------------------

This is a data mining project for understanding how businesses and neighborhoods interact.

We employ different clustering techniques to investigate the relationship between business dynamics
 and neighborhood characteristics. The former was revealed by clustering patronage patterns in Yelp data,
 the latter was shown by clustering neighborhoods by census data.

## Folder structure

- **code** - the Jupyter notebooks containing code for data processing and analysis.
- **data** - auxiliary datasets and intermediate tidy data files generated in the process.
- **tex** - the source code for the accompanying paper written in LaTex.

It you want to reproduce the data cleaning steps, you would also need to place the
[Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) in folder `../../yelp-data`, i.e.,
a folder called `yelp-data` two levels up from the root folder of this repository.
